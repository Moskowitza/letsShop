# Welcome to this landing page demo.

This page was created to demonstrate the simplicity of front end tools: HTML, CSS, Javascript.

## HTML5

I wrote the mark up to be clean and readable with CSS and JS disabled.

## CSS

The CSS is actually written with SCSS (SASS with curly brackets and semi-colons). Benefits of using Sass are nesting, variables and partials.

## JAVASCRIPT

The front end script used is written with vanilla JS (my favorite flavor). The JS is used to cycle through the HTML, CSS, JS descriptions.

## SVG images

I created the svg images myself in Adobe Illustrator. If you want to use them, go ahead.
